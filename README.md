# ref_infinity()
This EEGLAB plugin allows re-referencing EEG data (continuous or epoched) to infinity using the reference electrode standardization technique (REST).
Because the REST plugin developed by Dong et al. (2017) can only be used with the GUI, it cannot be automated to process files automatically. 
This plugin allows using the REST method via the command line, using the default parameters and 3-concentric sphere head model. 
By default, the leadfield matrix is calculated from the electrodes' cartesian coordinates. Users can input a different leadfield matrix or dipoles file, if needed. 
The method works for both continuous and epoched data (epoched data are converted back to continuous for referencing and then converted back to epoched).

## Requirements
- EEG data imported into EEGLAB without auxiliary electrodes (option to exclude specific electrodes coming soon)
- data must have at least 30 electrodes to be reliable
- channel locations loaded in the EEG structure (if not loaded, the plugin imports the default BEM coordinates template)

## Requirements
1) Have MATLAB and EEGLAB installed
2) Install the plugin:
    - EEGLAB GUI: File > Manage extensions > ref_rest_cmd

   or

    - unzipping or cloning this Github repo into EEGLAB's "plugins" folder
4) Import EEG data into EEGLAB and remove auxiliary electrodes (option to exclude specific electrodes from the referencing not currently available)
5) Have at least 30 electrodes to get reliable results
6) channel locations loaded in the EEG structure (although the plugin will import the default BEM coordinates if not already loaded)

## Usage

EEG = ref_infinity(EEG);                                           % reference to infinity using default parameters

EEG = ref_infinity(EEG, ,'leadfield','your_leadfield_file');       % specify another leadfield file

EEG = ref_infinity(EEG, ,'dipoles','corti869-3000dipoles.dat');    % specify another dipoles file

## Quick tests on sample data
This sample dataset (Neuroscan) contains 64-channel epoched data from one subject visualizing images from the IAPS database with either unpleasant or neutral emotional valence. Data were cleaned with ASR and ICA and epoched.

Sample data referenced to REST with the original plugin (GUI) vs this command line version, to ensure there are no errors in the new code
